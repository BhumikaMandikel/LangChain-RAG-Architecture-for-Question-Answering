# LangChain RAG Architecture for Question Answering

A comprehensive guide for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using LangChain for intelligent question answering with data retrieval.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a RAG architecture that combines document retrieval with language model generation to answer questions based on your knowledge base using LangChain's retrieval and prompting capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Process and index document
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity search for relevant context retrieval
- **Contextual Generation**: Generate accurate answers using retrieved documents as context

## Architecture Components

- **Document Loader**: Handles multiple file formats and data sources
- **Text Splitter**: Optimizes document chunking for retrieval accuracy
- **Embedding Model**: Converts text to vector representations
- **Vector Store**: Manages document embeddings and similarity search
- **Retriever**: Implements search strategies and result filtering

## Use Cases

- **Internal Knowledge Base**: Employee self-service for company documentation
- **Customer Support**: Automated responses based on product documentation
- **Research Assistant**: Academic paper analysis and summarization
- **Legal Document Review**: Contract and policy question answering
- **Technical Documentation**: Developer support and API guidance

- **Answer Quality Metrics**: Monitor user satisfaction and feedback
- **Usage Patterns**: Analyze common questions and knowledge gaps
- **System Health**: Monitor vector store performance and model availability
